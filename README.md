# wsn_non-plain_surfaces
The simulation consists of a surface creation, a random node distribution and a package transmission between nodes. Based on these three steps, packages between nodes are exchanged by means of the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. The algorithm needs as input how many nodes are deployed and the sensor range. After checking the connection between nodes, packages are created and transmitted to the following nodes. This process occurs repeatedly and helps to analyse existing parameters in the sensor networks deployed in non-plain surfaces.
